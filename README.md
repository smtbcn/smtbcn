Hello, my name is Samet.

I am a freelance web developer.

I am also writing some articles about web development. So if you're interested, you can read it here. But unfortunately it's only in Turkish for now :/

I started with HTML and CSS in 2010. I learned ASP and MySQL in 2011. I started learning Javascript a while ago.
My current passion is now Javascript.
Since 2011 I have been developing many web projects for my clients and myself.
