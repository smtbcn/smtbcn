Hello, my name is Samet BİÇEN.
I’m a freelance web developer specialized in backend and full-stack development.

I occasionally write articles about web technologies, databases, and performance optimization — you can check them out if you’re interested (though they’re currently available only in Turkish).

My journey began in 2010 with HTML and CSS, followed by Classic ASP and MySQL in 2011. Over the years, I’ve built and managed numerous web applications for both clients and my own projects.

Recently, my main focus has shifted towards JavaScript and modern web ecosystems — continuously improving performance, scalability, and user experience in my projects.
